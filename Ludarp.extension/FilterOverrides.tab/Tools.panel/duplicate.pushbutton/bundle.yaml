  Duplicate Parameter Filter with Same Overrides

  How to Use:

  1. Select a target view or template where the duplication will occur.  

  2. Select a source filter from the project.  

  3. Enter a new name for the duplicated filter.  

  The tool will create a new filter with the same categories and rules.  
  It also copies all graphic overrides (fill color, line color, patterns, transparency, etc.).  
  The duplicated filter is applied to the chosen view/template automatically.
