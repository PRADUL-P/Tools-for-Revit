  Duplicate Parameter Filter with Same Overrides

  How to Use:
  
   Selects a source filter.

  Enters a new name.

   It duplicates the filter with all its categories and rules.

  The current view overrides (fill color, line color, patterns, etc.) are copied exactly.

  The duplicated filter is applied to the current view automatically.
